    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
      As a resourceful individual with working experience in administrative
      roles, I have strong work ethic such as time management, good
      organizational, networking, and multitasking skills especially in
      cross-selling. Being an eloquent communicator gave me the leverage to
      convert prospects to clients who invested over 50million Naira through
      various platforms. This also gave me the opportunity to work with minimal
      or no supervision, learn how to manage, and build professional
      relationships with people. During my service year, I learnt how to
      properly pay attention to details especially since I oversaw planning,
      processing, and evaluation of official landed property documents. <br />
      Also, while interning at Chris Eyisanmi and Co firm, I was taught the pros
      and cons of telephone and email etiquette. Being a self-motivated
      individual, the organization helped me to learn and use office automation
      tools- Microsoft Office tools; Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.
